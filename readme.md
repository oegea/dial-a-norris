# Dial a Norris

Dial a Norris is a dial-a-joke kind of service that plays a different Chuck Norris fact every day.

The service has been made with training purposes, and can be tested by calling to `+34 936 940 047`.

Chuck Norris facts are in Spanish.

##Â Disclaimer

This is a personal side project made only to play around with Asterisk and Voip.

Although a very basic architectural splitting has been made to avoid mixing infrastructure and business logic, do not expect a great architecture or testing coverage.
